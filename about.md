# About

## Overview

I am an Industrial–Organizational Psychology student with a minor in Data Science, focused on Human Factors, AI systems, and human–machine interaction. My work centers on designing intelligent tools that enhance performance without increasing cognitive load.

I build and evaluate systems that combine:
- Applied machine learning  
- Human-centered design  
- Cognitive and behavioral science  
- Structured evaluation methods  

I am preparing to pursue a Master’s in Human Factors and aim to work at the intersection of AI, autonomy, and high-performance operational environments.

## Outside of Work

From a young age I have spent a lot of time lesrning about leadership and team dynamics. As a teenager, I particpated in and served in National Youth Leadership Training (aka Cedar Badge) culminating with running my own +30 person crew.
As an undergraduate student, I have had course work in Organizational Leadership and Industrial Organizational Psychology. I was a teachers assistant for over a year in Organizational Leadership responsible for teaching, grading, and supporting students.
