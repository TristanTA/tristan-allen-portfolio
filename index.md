  SELECTED CASE STUDIES (4-card grid)
  - Typography-only cards via feature_row.
  - Add /case-studies/ index page later to list all case studies.
============================================================ -->

## Selected Case Studies
Short, purpose-first summaries here. Full research/architecture detail lives on each case study page.

  ABOUT (why-driven) + Resume/CV links
  - Kept compact on homepage; full story goes on /about/.
  - Button styling uses built-in Minimal Mistakes classes.
============================================================ -->

## About
I build systems where **human cognition, constraints, and real-world usage** shape the design—not as an afterthought, but as the starting point. My work focuses on **AI-enabled tools** that support decision-making, planning, recall, and performance in applied settings. Most systems here are in **active development** and are documented honestly with clear scope, current state, and next steps.

  SKILLS SNAPSHOT (broader, grouped; no usability testing claim)
  - Keep this readable: grouped > long flat list.
  - Add usability testing later once you’ve done it and can point to artifacts.
============================================================ -->

## Skills Snapshot
**Human Factors & Research**
- Research methods (study design, measurement thinking, synthesis)
- Cognitive systems framing (workload, attention, decision support)
- Applied behavioral + I/O foundations (motivation, performance, systems fit)

**AI & Systems**
- Python-first system building
- LLM system design (prompting, routing, guardrails, reliability patterns)
- Applied ML prototyping (model selection, evaluation mindset, iteration)

**Data & Engineering**
- Data analysis & visualization mindset (cleaning → insight → action)
- SQL / structured storage basics (project-dependent)
- Git + repo workflow hygiene (docs, PR flow, automation)

<hr class="sep" />

<!-- ============================================================
  RESEARCH FOUNDATIONS (high-level for now)
  - Honest: foundations + intent, not “publications”.
  - Later: link artifacts (summaries, annotated bibliographies, experiment notes).
============================================================ -->

## Research Foundations
My projects are shaped by research questions like: *How do we reduce cognitive friction? How do we support recall? How do we turn ambiguity into action without overwhelming the user?*  
This section will expand as I publish artifacts (summaries, references, experiment logs, and evaluation results).

  PROJECT PREVIEW (5 items) + link to full list
  - All projects belong in /projects/ (including highlighted case studies).
  - Each line includes: name, repo link, purpose, why, current state.
============================================================ -->

## Project Preview
A small slice of the full list. Each entry is intentionally short and honest.

1) **LifeNotes** — [GitHub](https://github.com/TristanTA)  
Purpose: recall + retrieval support through practical capture workflows.  
Why: reduce friction between “I had a thought” and “I can find it later.”  
Current state: **Active development**; case study documents scope and roadmap.

2) **Alden** — [GitHub](https://github.com/TristanTA)  
Purpose: local-first assistant logic for planning, context, and automation.  
Why: build a reliable system that helps align actions with priorities (without noise).  
Current state: **Active development**; iterating on structure and tool reliability.

3) **Compass** — [GitHub](https://github.com/TristanTA)  
Purpose: decision-support concept for turning intent into clear next actions.  
Why: reduce ambiguity and cognitive load in goal selection and follow-through.  
Current state: **MVP / evolving**; under active refinement.

4) **Mira** — [GitHub](https://github.com/TristanTA)  
Purpose: portfolio agent for audits, fixes, and PR workflows with guardrails.  
Why: scale portfolio maintenance without sacrificing quality control.  
Current state: **Prototype → MVP**; reliability and workflow simplification ongoing.

5) **(Placeholder Project #5)** — [GitHub](https://github.com/TristanTA)  
Purpose: short one-liner.  
Why: short one-liner.  
Current state: **Prototype**.

  NOTES FOR YOU (safe to delete)
  1) Create pages later using the permalinks referenced above:
     /case-studies/, /case-studies/lifenotes/, /about/, /research/, /projects/, etc.
  2) If /assets/images/hero-pattern.svg is missing, the hero still works.
  3) “hr.sep” will render as a normal rule unless your CSS styles it—safe either way.
